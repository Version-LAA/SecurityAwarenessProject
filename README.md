# Security Awareness Program Development Template
As part of my security program and security awareness class for Sans, I developed a mock security awareness program that can be used by organization to mature their cyber security posture. The mock program is based on a fictional themepark without a mature security program. Executive summary can be seen below, with full writeup available : ![HERE](https://github.com/cybersecurebyte/SecurityAwarenessProgram/blob/main/SecurityAwarenessProgram_Latoya%20Jamison.pdf)

## Executive Summary

WestWorld is an industry leading vacation destination operated by Delos Destinations, Inc. The park is operated by majority artificial intelligent/android technology robots known as, “host”. The code and the advanced 3D printing technology used to create the host were created by Dr. Robert Ford and Arnold Weber. WestWorld provides a unique experience to all guests at every age. As all hosts are lifelike and provide guests the opportunity to experience a variety of unique storylines during their stay in the park. All hosts are unable to harm any guest it interacts with, and are preprogrammed to follow a set narratives(storylines) that play out daily, but are able to be interrupted by the park guest at their leisure. All hosts are reset every 24 hour period, and restart their preprogrammed narratives. 

Westworld Intellectual Property and park guest data make it a target for insider/external threats, as well as data breach attempts. Therefore, a new security awareness program will help educate and ensure all employees have the proper tools and knowledge to help protect the organization. This includes but is not limited to proprietary data/intellectual property, park guest or employee applicable PII. 

Currently, there is no standalone security awareness program within the organization, and security education is delivered primarily during employee orientation. The new security awareness program will not only help supplement security training taught during company orientation, but will also ensure continuous security awareness training in order to help promote security and assist the organization in reducing its human risk.

The new security awareness program will also ensure the organization maintains its PCI-DSS, SOX, ISO 2700 compliance requirements and standards.

The main goals of the WestWorld security awareness program is as follows:
- Educate employees on the importance of security of all data maintained by Westworld.
- Educate employees on the importance of physical/ cyber security in order to protect all intellectual property, company data, and physical safety of all employee and park guests.
- Reduce overall human risk and threat landscape of the organization.
- Ensure the company maintains compliance requirements.
